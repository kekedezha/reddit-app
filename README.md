## 🤓 Motivation

subReddit App was project idea to showcase my front-end development skills that incorporated friendly UI usability/accessibility/responsiveness, async JS and HTTP requests, coding standards, problem solving, version control, use of JS libraries and testing/debugging. This app combines the key skills required by Front-End Developers!

## 🛠️ Main Technologies

Front-End:

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`
- `React`
- `Redux`
- `Vite`
- `Vitest`

## 💡 Key Features

- Quick and accessible to Reddit.com
- Browse through the top 25 most popular subreddits
- Responsive Web Design
- View through comments on each post!
- Filter/search through the posts on the current subreddit

## 💻 Improvements

- Add oAuth2.0 to allow user accounts to be able to post, comment and view Reddit profile.
- Add user ability to view other subreddits other than the top 25
- In general add more functionality similar to the Reddit app for more user freedom.
- Ability to load more posts for each subreddit

## 🐛 Bugs

- When filtering posts using a search term input, posts comments do not populate on button click
- subReddit logo does not take user back to 'home' page
- Search term should start filtering on input. With current set up, user can delete search term and not know they are filtering posts

## 📈 Overall Growth:

This project in particular helped me continue to solidify front-end development skills that I have developing since transitioning over to becoming a Software Engineer/Developer. This has been the project where I finally felt comfortable implementing the Redux library (paired with React) and coming up with my own testing scrips. I'll probably be using this project as a reference as I continue to build more projects in the future!
